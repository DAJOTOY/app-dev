### **Hungry Game**
The **Hunger Games** is a popular dystopian science fiction film based on the novel by Suzanne Collins. The story occurs in a fictional future nation called Panem, divided into the Capitol and 12 districts. Each year, the Capitol hosts a brutal event called "The Hunger Games," where one boy and one girl (known as "tributes") from each district are chosen to participate in a televised fight to the death. The event is meant to remind the districts of the Capitol’s control and suppress any thoughts of rebellion.

The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), volunteers to take her sister’s place as a tribute for District 12. Katniss must use her survival skills, intelligence, and archery expertise to stay alive in the arena and navigate the dangerous world of alliances, betrayal, and psychological challenges created by the Capitol.
